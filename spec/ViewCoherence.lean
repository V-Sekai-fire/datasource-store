/-! # View coherence: every transaction on a file checks the view its handle holds

A handle caches the store. SQLite keeps a page cache, and under `locking_mode=EXCLUSIVE` it
never re-reads page 1 to learn that the file changed; the VFS keeps the dirty buffer, the
read-ahead window, the head and the shard version. All of it describes the store as this
handle last left it.

The fence is what makes that description true for a writer: another writer raises the fence
before it writes, so while the fence still equals the handle's, nobody else has written.
`check_fence` in `fdb_vfs.c` reads the fence inside every write transaction. It read it inside
no read transaction, so a handle whose fence had moved kept reading pages, and a page read
after the move sat beside a page cached before it. A B-tree assembled from two databases is
not a database. In Uro that was a SIGSEGV in `sqlite3BtreeInsert`, on an upload through a
handle that had already been refused a write.

The comment on `check_fence` says it: a fence that covers one write path and not the others
is not a fence. The same sentence holds across reads and writes, and this file is that
sentence made checkable. Two parts:

* **Coverage.** Every `*_body` in `fdb_vfs.c` is a row of `Body`, with its scope and whether it
  checks the view. `file_bodies_check_view` is decided over the whole list, so a file-scoped
  body that skips the check is a failed build. `before_fix` keeps the table as it stood at
  `72e3fdf` and shows the theorem false there, which is the negative control.
  `check_bodies.sh` holds `Body` against the C, so a body added to one and not the other
  fails the `spec` stage.
* **Meaning.** `coherent` says what a passed check buys. It is also what keeps a SQLite
  transaction inside FoundationDB's semantics when it outlives one FoundationDB transaction,
  as a long read does at the cached transaction's four-second mark and a large commit does by
  staging: every read version a SQLite transaction runs on is the same store state or the
  read is refused, so the SQLite transaction sees one state, as a FoundationDB one does. In the protocol as `fdb_vfs.c` runs it
  — a writer raises the fence at open, a commit or a fold is refused unless the fence is the
  writer's — a store whose fence equals a handle's has that handle's head and shard version.
  So a transaction whose check passed reads the store the cache was built on.

What this does not claim. SQLite answering a query from its own cache never calls the VFS,
and the VFS cannot reach it. That read is stale rather than mixed: it hands SQLite no page
from a store it does not own. A reader that wants to follow the head keeps NORMAL locking,
where SQLite reads page 1 at every transaction and the check runs; `prove_fence_read.c` is
both cases, measured.
